# **nspire**

A growing collection of small mathematical and computational explorations, written in Python. Each script focuses on a self‑contained idea — number theory, iterative processes, or alternative numeral systems — with more tools to be added over time.

## 📂 Current Scripts

### **mayan.py**
Implements base‑20 (vigesimal) conversions and Mayan‑style numeral logic. Useful for experimenting with alternative number systems or integrating with TI‑Nspire Lua projects.

### **collatz.py**
Runs Collatz sequence explorations, including iterative steps, stopping times, and optional tracing. A lightweight sandbox for playing with one of mathematics’ most famous unsolved problems.

### **kaprekar.py**
Performs Kaprekar routines (e.g., the 6174 process) and related digit‑manipulation experiments. Designed for quick iteration and pattern‑spotting.

## 🚀 Future Additions
This repository will expand over time with more scripts, utilities, and mathematical experiments. The goal is to keep each module simple, readable, and easy to run from the command line or integrate into other tools.

## 🛠 Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- No external dependencies for the current scripts

## 📜 License
You can add a license here later (MIT is a common choice).
